## Computer Gaming

I've been playing computer games in one form or another since 1985.  I had to know enough about MS-DOS to run the games because Windows 3.0 wasn't available yet.

### My First Game

My first computer game, a role-playing game on an IBM PC, was [Ultima III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_III:_Exodus) by Origin Systems.
I remember installing and playing the game a while before digging into the documentation.  I think there were 3 20-page manuals that came with the game.  The documentation (and additional cloth map) gave me an impression that the creators were really into creating their own world.

### Online Multiplayer

As I grew older I played more complex games (including others in the Ultima series) and eventually got into first-person shooters like [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) and [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)).
In 1995, I discovered [DWANGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWANGO) and was able to play online multiplayer games for the first time.  I was hooked.

### Submarine Games

I'm betting that my choice to enter the Navy as a submariner probably came from my exposure to several submarine computer games.
I will say there's a lot more action in the games (and less cleaning and maintenance) than in real life.

I remember specifically playing:
- Gato
- Silent Service
- Silent Serice II
- 688 Attack Sub

### Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games

The first MMORPG I'd played was [Asheron's Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheron%27s_Call) in 1999.  It really reminded me of the RPG that entered me into PC gaming, and it added the ability to play with others.
I actually believe that playing games of this nature made me very resistant to real life scams and also cemented in my mind that you almost always have to be a team player in order to succeed in these games.

I'd played multiple other MMORPGs and actually met my girlfriend while playing [Final Fantasy XI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XI).

## Running

I enjoy running!  I recently started again in order to ensure I was getting exercise while working remotely.
I've been running daily for about a year.  The initial motivation was a 1-mile walk when I was feeling back pain one day.
I've kept with it and now try to either walk or jog a 5K every day.

I did run the Marine Corps Marathon in the past and also did the Zappos Half Marathon in Las Vegas.

## Tournament Hosting

I used to volunteer for _[MPlayer.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer.com)_ and later _[Gamespy Arcade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpy_Arcade)_ as a Tournament Host when those services were still live.
The program was called the "Wizards" program and was separated into different genres covering the game types that the platform was hosting.  I fell into the Action genre and would usually volunteer once a week to engage with a specific gaming community.

There were usually three people assigned to run the tournaments.  The roles usually consisted of:
- Matchmaker - The Wizard assigned here would normally create and track the players in the brackets.
- Live web - The matchmaker would normally feed the information to the live web Wizard so that participants could track the progress in real time.
- Moderator - The moderator Wizard would usually serve as the event MC, lead for the event, and would submit the results to MPlayer/Gamespy Arcade for reward distribution.
