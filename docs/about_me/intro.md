# Introduction

I'm a Senior Technical Writer that took a non-traditional path into this career.
I do not have a formal degree and actually started technical writing as a collateral duty while I was in the Navy.

I was one of two people in my division designated to go to a QAI (Quality Insurance Inspector) school.
A [SUBSAFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUBSAFE) valve had to be replaced during one of the refit periods; I was assigned to that task.
I wrote my first CWP (Controlled Work Package) and successfully had the valve replaced and tested prior to the upcoming patrol.
I did not know then that my post-military career would eventually end up in the Technical Writing field.

The Submarine Safety Program (SUBSAFE) is a quality assurance program of the United States Navy designed to maintain the safety of its submarine fleet, specifically, to provide maximum reasonable assurance that submarine hulls will stay watertight, and that they can recover from unanticipated flooding.

It was brought about after the loss of the _USS Thresher (SSN-593)_ in 1963.

I've served as a Technical Writer in the following roles/fields:
