# Introduction

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="work" label="Work-Related" default>

        I'm a Senior Technical Writer that took a non-traditional path into this career.
        I do not have a formal degree and actually started technical writing as a collateral duty while I was in the Navy.

        I was one of two people in my division designated to go to a QAI (Quality Insurance Inspector) school.
        A [SUBSAFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUBSAFE) valve had to be replaced during one of the refit periods; I was assigned to that task.
        I wrote my first CWP (Controlled Work Package) and successfully had the valve replaced and tested prior to the upcoming patrol.
        I did not know then that my post-military career would eventually end up in the Technical Writing field.


        :::info

        The Submarine Safety Program (SUBSAFE) is a quality assurance program of the United States Navy designed to maintain the safety of its submarine fleet, specifically, to provide maximum reasonable assurance that submarine hulls will stay watertight, and that they can recover from unanticipated flooding.

        It was brought about after the loss of the _USS Thresher (SSN-593)_ in 1963.

        I've served as a Technical Writer in the following roles/fields:

        I've used multiple tools and Content Management Systems to produce documentation, but find that I really love a "Docs as Code" setup.

        I believe that a good Project Manager needs to be able to `adapt` to changing scopes and shifting deadlines, must be `consistent` with steps in a workflow and create a recognizable set of expectations for SMEs, and must `communicate` changes to the Program Manager, SMEs, and other Technical Writers to keep everyone synced.
        The left hand must know what the right hand is doing.

        I was born in Mainz, Germany.

        My first language was actually German.  My ability to speak German these days has suffered; I haven't been able to practice much.  I do find that I still understand what is being spoken, especially when watching TV.

        My father was a helicopter ([OH-58D Kiowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_OH-58_Kiowa)) pilot in the United States Army through the aviation Warrant Officer program.

        ![Kiowa](./img/kiowa.jpg)

        This caused us to move around a lot as my father would receive orders.  I was perpetually the "new kid" in school.
        My eventual orders and contract jobs aided this as well.

        I've lived in the following locations:
        - Mainz, Germany
        - Baumholder, Germany
        - Fort Ord, California
        - Ozark, Alabama
        - Furth, Germany
        - Fort Rucker, Alabama
        - Ansbach, Germany
        - Fayetteville, North Carolina
        - Great Lakes, Illinois
        - Orlanda, Florida
        - Groton, Connecticut
        - Newport, Rhode Island
        - Kingsland, Georgia
        - Charlotte, North Carolina
        - Fairfax, Virginia
        - Germantown, Maryland
        - Summerville, South Carolina
