# Stock Trading

I enjoy trading stocks.  I'd initially started by using a stock market simulator application.
I'd eventually used USAA, Robinhood, and E-trade.

There were several successful trades, but the one with the most success was in AMD.

When I sold it later, I used it to fund the purchase of my house.
