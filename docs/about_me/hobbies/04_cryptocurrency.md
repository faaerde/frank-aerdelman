# Cryptocurrency Mining

I used to mine cryptocurrency (alt coins) back when the difficulty was lower.

I'd previously used 2x _AMD R9 290X_ graphics cards to mine both Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in a mining pool in 2013.

After mining them, I'd trade back and forth on _Crypsy.com_ (before it was shut down) for 10% gains with limit orders:
- **LTC --> DOGE**
- **DOGE --> LTC**
