# Running

I enjoy running!

I recently started again in order to ensure I was getting exercise while working remotely.
I've been running daily for about a year.  The restarted back in September 2024 with daily 1-mile walks.
I've kept with it and now try to either walk, hike, or jog a 5K every day.

I did run the [Marine Corps Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Marathon) and did the [Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Half Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roll_Las_Vegas_Marathon).
