# Running

I enjoy running!

In order to ensure I was getting exercise while working remotely I began with daily 1-mile walks.
I've kept with it for over a year now.
I now try to either walk, hike, or jog a 5K every day as a daily task.

While at BAE Systems, I participated in a marathon for charity.

I did run the [Marine Corps Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Marathon) and did the [Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Half Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roll_Las_Vegas_Marathon).
