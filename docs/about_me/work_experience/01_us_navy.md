### Details

I joined the Navy in 1996 and was initially designated as an Electrician's Mate.
I attended Electrician's Mate "A" School in Orlando, FL when Navy Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC) was based there.

I cross-rated to Missile Technician and attended Submarine School at New London Submarine Base in Groton, CT.
Missile Technician "A" School and Missile Technician "C" School followed before I was able to choose my submarine assignment.
