### Details

I joined the Navy in 1996 and was initially designated as an Electrician's Mate.
I attended Electrician's Mate "A" School in Orlando, FL when the [Navy Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Nuclear_Power_Training_Command) was based there.

Missile Technician "A" School and Missile Technician "C" School followed before I was able to choose my submarine assignment.

#### FCET (Follow-on Commander's Evaluation Test)

We were able to launch two missiles to support FCET 21 in April 1999.
The FCET launches a specially modified missile without a nuclear payload, and is used to test the performance of the Trident missile system.
Northern Test Unit (NOTU) comes onboard and replaces the nuclear warheads with telemetry warheads and they install destruct sets, just in case a termination is required after launch.

#### SINKEX (Sink Exercise)

I also had the rare opportunity (as an Ohio-class submariner) to be part of a SINKEX with the _USS John F. Kennedy Battlegroup_ in October 2001.
The [Ex-USS Guam (LPH-9)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Guam_(LPH-9)) was sunk for training as an artificial reef at _031° 14' 22.0" North, 071° 16' 35.0" West_ via a [Mark 48 ADCAP torpedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_48_torpedo) from the USS Maryland.

#### September 11, 2001

I was on patrol when the events of September 11 unfolded.
The immediate change in mood on the sub, the lack of information, and the difference between security when we left and when we came back are the only things I really remember well.

I did 6 hours of faulted targeting, as training, during the previous watch.
As I was walking towards my rack to get some rest before my next watch when I heard "Set [DEFCON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFCON) 3; station the targeting team."
The targets I'd entered then were clean, no faults anywhere. Everything was perfect.

Most of what we'd learned was copied via a satellite downlink and printed to paper.
We didn't get any footage until a later BSP brought it aboard so a lot of time was spent reading and rereading the printout.
