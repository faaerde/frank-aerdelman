### Details

Much of the work here was in DITA/XML using ArborText Epic Editor or FrameMaker, depending on the site requesting the work.
I had no previous _aviation_ technical writing experience so I had to learn about additional requirements (like simplified English).

The job usually requested a recreation and update of an older manual, usually with no previous source from a company that was no longer in business.

When new manuals needed to be created, they'd follow a specific style guide and get newly created art, new procedures, and an illustrated parts list.
The books I specifically worked on were usually associated with networking equipment or lighting for aerial refueling tankers.  They'd usually average about 300 pages.
I usually had to interface with a site-specific SME (Urbana, IL or Redmond, WA) to get the technical content verified before I could close on a task.
