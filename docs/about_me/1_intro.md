# Introduction

I'm a Senior Technical Writer that took a non-traditional path into this career.

I do not have a formal degree and actually started technical writing as a collateral duty while I was in the Navy.  I was one of two people in my division that was designated to go to a QAI (Quality Insurance Inspector) school.  A SUBSAFE valve had to be replaced during one of the refit periods; I was assigned to that task.  I wrote my first CWP (controlled work package) and successfully had the valve replaced and tested prior to the upcoming patrol.

I've since served as a Technical Writer in the following fields:

- Ohio-Class submarine Troubleshooting documentation - FII/FIT IETMs and OP 4628/4629
- A USPS sorting machine called the FSS
- Operator's Manual and Maintenance Manual for the Buffalo A2 MRAP
- Aviation Manuals for Boeing, Airbus, and Sikorsky
- Semiconductor documentation for Microservers
- Foundry documentation

I've used multiple tools and Content Management Systems to produce documentation, but find that I really love a "Docs as Code" setup.
