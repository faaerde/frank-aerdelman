# Introduction

I'm a Senior Technical Writer that took a non-traditional path into this career.

I do not have a formal degree and actually started technical writing as a collateral duty while I was in the Navy.
I was one of two people in my division that was designated to go to a QAI (Quality Insurance Inspector) school.
A [SUBSAFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUBSAFE) valve had to be replaced during one of the refit periods; I was assigned to that task.
I wrote my first CWP (Controlled Work Package) and successfully had the valve replaced and tested prior to the upcoming patrol.
I did not know then that my post-military career would eventually end up in the Technical Writing field.

I've served as a Technical Writer in the following roles/fields:

- (Navy) Ohio-Class submarine Troubleshooting documentation - Fault Indication Index/Fault Isolation Tree (FII/FIT) [IETMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_electronic_technical_manual) and OP 4628/4629
- (USPS) A United States Postal Service sorting machine called the [Flats Sequencing System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flats_Sequencing_System) (FSS) - ~44,000 page manual
- (Army) Operator's Manual (1,000 pages) and Maintenance Manual (10,000 pages) for the [Buffalo A2 MRAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_(mine_protected_vehicle))
- (Aviation) Manuals for Boeing, Airbus, and Sikorsky
- (Semiconductor) Microserver/Storage documentation
- (Semiconductor) Foundry documentation

I've used multiple tools and Content Management Systems to produce documentation, but find that I really love a "Docs as Code" setup.
