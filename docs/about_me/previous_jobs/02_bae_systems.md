- Developed process to convert paper FII/FITs to electronic Technical Information Databases (TIDB) and converted all
existing FII/FITs to an Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) format.
- Integrated Launcher System Control Group (LSCG) into currently existing Strategic Weapon System and Ship
Support Fault Isolation Trees.
- Analyzed developments in specific fields to determine the need for revisions, corrections and changes in previously
published materials, and the development of new materials.
- Assisted with development of new Fault Indication Indexes and Fault Isolation Procedures for the Guided Missile
Submarine (SSGN) Attack Weapon System.
- Represented BAE FII/FIT during SWS Weeks at King's Bay and Kitsap submarine bases to receive direct feedback
from fleet personnel and SWS contractors with respect to possible future changes or upcoming modifications and to
address any issues related to BAE developed content.
- Read, interpreted, and applied specifications from core drawings, cabling diagrams, schematics, technical manuals,
and other publications and source material to ensure correct troubleshooting paths and increase FIT accuracy.
- Developed Operating Procedures technical manual for use with Organic Post Mission Analysis (OPMA) workstations
following an AQS-20A mine detection SONAR deployment by MH-60S Seahawk helicopters.
